### Hello there! 

My name is Din and I am a full-time PHP developer at Internet-expert.ru with Laravel/Bitrix framework as my primary stack. My total experience is approaching 7 years (most of which i didn't do much useful, focusing solely on simple and intermediate android games, but the number is cool, so I'm sticking with it anyway). I dedicate whatever free time I can afford to creating several projects of my own (mostly written in Lua with support of Solar2D (ex Corona SDK)). My main focus among these projects is creating my own cross-platform framework for Solar that once complete, will allow the developer to concentrate entirely on implementing and testing new features as quickly as possible without having to worry about the overall architecture, storing data, client-server interactions or creating views of any complexity from scratch instead of using built-in solutions (for those who never heard of Solar, that's one of the main problems when it comes to using it for applications, since the engine itself is designed for games primarily). 

I'm also starting to do a lot of coding in Java building RESTful Spring backends for my projects. I have some experinece in native Android having worked on apps in both Java and Kotlin using such technologies as Room, Hilt, Material UI and Retrofit. 

In 2022 I plan to focus on getting better at backend development (it's still a new field for me, since out of those 7 years, 6 are nothing but mobile dev). I'm also planning to achieve quite a lot with Sptring + Hibernate and create the very first public release of my framework.
