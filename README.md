# Hello there and welcome to my informal resume! 

## About
My name is **Din** and I am a full-time **Java** developer at **Luxoft** with **Spring/Hibernate/Corda** as my primary stack. My total experience is approaching 7 years the first half of which I spent on developing iOS and Android games of various complexity, developing my own projects and working at several startups that did not become very successful. I dedicate whatever free time I can afford to creating several projects of my own (mostly written in **Lua** with support of **Solar2D** (ex Corona SDK)). My main focus among these projects is creating my own **cross-platform framework** for Solar that once complete, will allow the developer to concentrate entirely on implementing and testing new features as quickly as possible without having to worry about the overall architecture, storing data, client-server interactions or creating views of any complexity from scratch instead of using built-in solutions (for those who never heard of Solar, those are some of the main problems when it comes to using it for applications, since the engine itself is designed for games primarily). In the later years I switched more towards Java and Kotlin and become an Android developer. After some time I decided to become a **Backend developer** starting off with Spring then switching to PHP/Laravel and then returning back to Spring with more knowledge and erxperience.

## Experience
I have several years of commerical **Lua** (also mostly Corona/Solar) development experience at various startups, **both game and app oriented**. I have developed two modest sized **frameworks** (plus the one I mentioned earlier). Those were used to drammatically simplify the development process of the end products one of which was the visual novel and the other used my vast custom made **UI component library** + a **scene manager**. 
My experience with **Java** residece around building RESTful **Spring** backends for my personal projects and also working as a full-time Spring developer. I have decent experinece with native **Android** having worked on apps in both **Java** and **Kotlin** using such technologies as **Room**, **Hilt**, **Material UI** and **Retrofit**. 

## Achievements
- Developed **Solar Engine framework**. Even though the state of it is trully frightening (lots of poor quality code from the days of yore + almost no documentation), but it still performs excellently
- Developed a **Lua OOP implementation** (not the firs, not the fastest but the truest of them all in terms of modern OOP languages)
- Developed a **vast library** of various simple and intermidate complexity **UI components** for Solar2d
- Developed a Lua written **ORM** for sqlite
- Implemented a lot of optimizing for my previous Spring projects
- Participated in creating architectural solutions for a number of Spring backends (my main contribution has always been creating relational database schemas)
